            Ticketmaster is the most convenient and easy application for
            ticketing. When looking for live events or concerts, people browse
            Ticketmaster first, versus their competitors. They also target the
            skeptical purchaser segment well, as when an event is promoted by
            Ticketmaster, consumers know they are 1) getting a legitimate ticket
            and 2) are not getting scammed or frauded. Another segment they
            target well is the perfect ticket buyer. Ticketmaster’s interactive
            seating tools allow consumers to purchase tickets in the exact seat
            they want.&nbsp;

            <strong>Current Revenue Model/Stream</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is also important to note Ticketmaster’s revenue model.
            Ticketmaster makes money by collecting a percentage of all tickets
            sold on their platform. Ticketmaster sold roughly 151 million
            tickets on their platform in 2021, where they collect 10% of fees
            from sellers, and just under 20% of service fee’s from the buyer on
            every ticket sold. They have a commission-based B2B2C model.

                The "join now" button front and center are important for new
                consumers. The first phrase, "free tickets are just a click
                away!" then having the button below is an immediate call to
                action for users. Consumers who identify as "product testers"
                will immediately sign up without knowing more about the program.

                The "login" and "register" buttons are in the top right corner.
                The "Log in" feature would be for existing users wanting to
                check in on their reward progress, and the register button is
                for those who want to create a new Ticketmaster account (not
                necessarily enroll in the rewards program)

                When dealing with incentive-based programs, there will also be
                certain types of analytical and quantitative people who need to
                know precisely how incentives are distributed. The next section
                provides in-depth information on how many points users would
                earn when buying tickets and how to capitalize on getting the
                most bang for your buck. The rewards distribution section
                showcases all this while also letting people know that AMEX
                members, who have a strategic partnership with Ticketmaster
                already, can earn double the amount of points than regular
                users.

            The spending rewards section explains how users can redeem the free
            ticket claims while also explaining the obvious restrictions when
            doing so. The graphic on the side will let people know an estimate
            of how many points would be needed to redeem specific tickets
            (depending on ticket price). Spoiler alert! Users would have to
            redeem many points to claim a free ticket.

                Of course, with any program like this, users will be left many
                questions, especially those who are skeptical or want to ensure
                there is "no catch." Because of this, we will have an FAQ forum
                for those who want to see what other people are saying/asking
                regarding this program. We hope by this point if users do not
                have further questions, the "join now" prompt at the bottom of
                the page will allow users to sign up for the program. If not,
                the "contact us" button will allow users to ask those last few
                questions to have all of their doubts or questions put to rest.

                    The most significant risk we identify is not having
                    sufficiently validated the problem. The way to mitigate this
                    is to keep listening to customers, but above all, to listen
                    to the right customers who will use the new feature
                    (students, startup owners, and company employees).

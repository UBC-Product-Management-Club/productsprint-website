              For this project, I acted as a PM for the popular music streaming
              platform, Spotify. I performed user research to find pain points
              and then utilized various design thinking tools to brainstorm
              solutions to improve the user experience.

              <strong>Introducing my Favorite Product</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Spotify is an app I use on a daily basis because it enhances my
              daily life while requiring low levels of effort. It is great for
              discovering and listening to music. I am easily able to find music
              according to my taste while also being able to expose myself to
              other types of music through Spotify or user created playlists. It
              is one of the biggest music streaming services on the market
              currently with over 433 million monthly users. Its freemium
              revenue model is attractive to young consumers because it allows
              them to explore the platform for free. In this model, the free
              version is a limited ad-supported service and the paid premium
              version offers unlimited access within the platform. It has an
              edge over other music streaming services because it allows its
              users to discover new content easily through self exploration and
              AI driven recommendation.

            user experience. It is personalized to each user and their
            behavioural patterns. The platformâ€™s focus on the individual makes
            it a space where users feel valued and catered to. Regardless, the
            app is isolating for users as it does not allow for much interaction
            with other users within the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its current form, Spotify allows users to see public playlists
            made by other users on the platform. People are also able to see in
            real time what their friends are listening to but there is no
            opportunity for direct interaction. Further, if users want to share
            content with others, they have to do so through other applications
            such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Whatsapp, and iMessage. This
            is inconvenient and requires a lot more effort.&nbsp;

            Beyond sharing content with each other, there is also no way for
            people to share their reactions and feedback to specific content
            matters. For example, if a content makes people feel a certain way,
            there is no way for other users to be privy to that. If it was not
            that way, there would be greater potential for community building.

          <p>
            For the purpose of my research, I look at various online articles
            and public forums where people expressed their frustrations with the
            Spotify platform. Further, I asked my friends and roommates about
            their experience on the platform. There are a wide variety of pain
            points but I specifically focused on the social aspects of the
            platform. Mainly, I am interested in the interactive and explorative
            elements of socializing on Spotify.

            are closely connected.

            In summary, the specific pain points of not being able to interact
            with friends more on the platform and also not being able to
            discover the right music in a timely manner become evident. These
            two pain points can be addressed together to make the Spotify user
            experience more human. Allowing people to share their experience can
            validate their need for interactions and the data derived from their
            activity can go on to enhance the discoverability aspect for other
            users.&nbsp;

          <h2 class='text-xl'>Conclusion</h2>
          <h2 class='text-lg'>Risks:</h2>
          <p>
            A potential risk that could arise from the solution is that users
            might not understand how the react feature works in the social
            context (i.e., the songs they react to are put into a personal
            playlist but are also compiled into a group playlist with friends).
            There are two ways to address this issue.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Internally</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Create distinct branding for the new feature so the new additions
            will stand out to the user immediately. If they are hyper aware of
            the new feature initially then they will purposely explore it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Externally</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide a demo or brief explanation to the user of what the new
            feature is and how they can use it.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 class='text-lg'>Reflection:</h2>
          <p>
            Through this project I learned the importance of Discovery. If I had
            more time, I would refine my research process and reach out to a
            wider demographic. Quality user research is critical in being able
            to identify relevant pain points that can be addressed at the right
            time for maximum impact. Coming into the project, I had some ideas
            for the solution feature I wanted to build but I quickly learned
            that this approach introduced bias into the problem identification
            process. When working on the construction side of the platform, it
            can be very different from the actual user experience. Therefore it
            is vital to be able to let go of the biases that come with being
            associated with the product and consider the users perspectives. As
            important as users are to a PMs role, so are stakeholders.
            Communication and negotiation are key when it comes to getting
            buy-in from others within the company. Sometimes situations may
            arise where PMs have to pivot from their original plans or abandon
            it all together so it is important to not get emotionally attached
            to a particular solution and always take into account competing
            factors.

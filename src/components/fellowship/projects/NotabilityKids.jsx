                  done in the UK, at age six, 85% of children say they have
                  access to a tablet at home, and 40% have their own. Technology
                  is a primary way children interact, therefore proving it to be
                  a staple in their life (especially when this market has
                  practically grown up with technology).

                  generation strives to live a more sustainable lifestyle than
                  the older generation.

            <p>
              Screen time for children has a bad reputation. Learning new things
              or exercising creativity on an iPad is not the same as watching TV
              for hours on end.

              <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Risks:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The market research I conducted was more toward Notability as a
              whole and not toward early childhood education apps. I didn't get
              to go super in-depth but from my research, I did find it is a
              large market with lots of room for growth. Many apps don't require
              a stylus however Notability Kids will prepare children for the
              real world and provides additional mobility skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another risk would be related to children's short attention spans.
              Therefore, I want to implement daily challenges where you can earn
              points (stars), which can be used for prizes determined in the
              future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Next steps</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If I had more time, I would flesh out the daily challenge system.
              I would also implement customization for the tiger/avatar, where
              kids could interact with it a little more. I would also include a
              more detailed "report card view" in the parent's view. I would
              also flesh out the pricing more, using market research to
              determine this.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Learnings</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned how to follow through with an idea, completely fail,
              pivot and then start again. This was one of the most valuable
              lessons for me as I got to really "think" like a PM instead of a
              student where you have all the instructions laid out for you!

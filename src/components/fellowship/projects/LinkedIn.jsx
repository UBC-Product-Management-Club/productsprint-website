            <strong>Introducing LinkedIn Jobs</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the favourite software products that I frequently use is
            LinkedIn. I love the platform because it has allowed me to meet and
            connect with many brilliant individuals. But not every software
            comes without flaws, and I can see the platform growing and serving
            its purpose in many areas. For example, through my job search, I
            realized that the application section does not update user
            application status, and I find that to be discouraging for
            applicants desperately looking for opportunities. The job category
            only includes a section for the jobs applied but does not let the
            user know where in the application process they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another aspect that I see the platform improving is its subscription
            features provided explicitly to users who are looking for jobs and
            want their profiles to be in priorityâ€”adding a job-seeking
            subscription model with the features mentioned below that target
            users looking for jobs and needing specific
            accommodations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <strong>Hypothesis</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            LinkedIn can increase user engagement and usability of their job
            search feature by allowing users to track and manage each stage of
            their job application.

            <strong>Assumptions</strong>

          <ul class='list-disc list-inside pl-6'>
            <li>
              <p>
                Job-seekers tend to receive more feedback and have a higher
                chance of acquiring a job if they have online/hybrid
                interactions with their recruiter.&nbsp;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Job-seekers feel more engaged and motivated to apply for jobs
                when they receive personalized feedback and understand what
                level of knowledge their recruiters expect.&nbsp;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                LinkedIn would increase its user engagement and revenue model by
                introducing new features and subscription models to cater to how
                job-seekers engage with their platform to find job
                opportunities.&nbsp;

                recruiters are looking for and what level of knowledge is
                expected through the interviewing process. (I.e. a set of

            <strong>Research Overview</strong>

          <p>
            After reading many articles and Reddit threads<strong> </strong>on
            LinkedIn users who have had no luck securing the jobs they have
            applied for, it became clear that LinkedIn job-seeker shares the
            same distaste towards their ignored messages and time-consuming
            over-looked applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few examples of how users are experiencing job searching
            using LinkedIn:&nbsp;

            During my research, it was crucial to differentiate applicant skill
            levels to understand better if this issue still exists in more
            senior-level applicants. LinkedIn has a variety of users that use
            and engage with the platform and online communities for different
            purposes. Thus, I focused on researching the pain points of junior
            to senior-level undergraduates and graduates looking for internships
            and part-time/full-time job opportunities using the LinkedIn job
            application tool.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Through extensive secondary research and conducting multiple user
            interviews with my target users, it became clear that LinkedIn's job
            application tracking and messaging services require optimization.
            More on this in the Solution phase.

            <strong>User Persona</strong>

          <p>
            I have focused on interviewing the job-seeker/applicant side of the
            LinkedIn job search feature. In addition, I targeted undergraduate
            and graduate student experiences using the platform. These users
            typically look for internships and or full-time opportunities all
            year round.
          </p>
          <p>
            My user research revealed that my targeted user primarily uses
            LinkedIn as a secondary resource for exploring job opportunities.
            These users use the platform more for networking purposes with
            recruiters and others in interested companies. The User Persona
            below highlights a graduate student with prior work experience using
            the app for job search purposes.&nbsp;

            <strong>Findings</strong>

          <p>
            There are three main opportunities identified through my secondary
            and primary user research. Application tracking and responsiveness
            are one of the most common pain points that affect users. Thus I
            will focus on optimizing the application tracking system as the
            first part of my project.

            Based on the RICE framework, improving the Tracking In-Progress Job
            Applications provides the most value to-effort ratio. The reason is
            that LinkedIn has already implemented features that can further help
            develop this feature. The Real-Time Applications Status Updates and
            Job Preparedness Suggestions are great ideas that will provide
            clarity and confidence in users' job search; however, it requires
            features to be developed on the recruitment side and should be a
            project later. Overall, the goal is to increase users' job
            acceptance rate; therefore, tracking applications for users can
            incentivize users them complete more applications that may result in
            higher chances of acceptance.&nbsp;

            <strong>Value Proposition</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Implementing a tracking feature for in-progress job applications
            ensures that users can understand the steps to their application
            process and feel more incentivized to complete more applications,
            thus leading to higher chances of job acceptance. In addition,
            knowing and sorting where users are in the application process makes
            managing their job search more seamless.&nbsp;

          <p>
            Based on user interviews, persona development, and LinkedIn visual
            interface, the following user requirements are the following:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ol class='list-decimal list-inside pl-6'>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users need to have progress bars for each position available
                while filling out job applications.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It should be possible for users to distinguish between the jobs
                for which they are being interviewed.&nbsp;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users should see their job application summary in their home
                dashboard.

            <strong>Trade-offs:&nbsp;</strong>LinkedIn aims for minimalistic and
            consistent designs. The two different progress bar colours and an
            individual "Interview" section in the "Job" dashboard may contrast
            with their design language.

            <strong>Risks and Mitigation</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            This project's significant risk and assumption are that recruiters
            and companies are open to integrating LinkedIn applicants with their
            main recruiting software.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies must share and update onboarding processes with LinkedIn
            to update job applications in real time for users to manage. This
            decision could raise data privacy issues within companies, and some
            third-party recruitment might need additional privacy access to use
            such a feature.&nbsp; &nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 class='text-lg'>
            <strong>Looking Forward</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            So far in this project, I have focused on researching the applicant
            side of LinkedIn job searchers; however, I am planning to do more
            user research on the pain points of recruiters using this
            platform.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 class='text-lg'>
            <strong>Learnings</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            During this time, I learned not to rely on my assumptions about the
            solution and look into what my target users experience using this
            platform. Collect as much feedback using secondary and primary
            market research. In addition, I learned to use new feature
            prioritization frameworks, such as Kano Model and RICE, to balance
            the value and effort needed to create my features. I also had the
            chance to sharpen my user interview skills, prepare and ask my users
            open-ended questions, and let them expand on their pain points. This
            technique has allowed me to identify new potential features that can
            be explored and improved in my project's subsequent phases.&nbsp;

            Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous, allowing all
            users regardless of profession and location to feel empowered to
            customize the software they use every day to their exact needs. It
            aims to increase user productivity by blending their workflows into
            an all-in-one workspace. It wants to be versatile in its many
            features, being able to use various components while remaining
            completely customizable.

            Notion’s current goal/trajectory is to continue expanding its
            product features (ex. template library) to appeal to a larger
            audience, instead of students and project management professionals.
            To do this, Notion is integrating third-party tools on the platform,
            developing more customizable templates, and allowing users to host
            templates on a webpage.&nbsp;

            Notion is designed to help individuals and members of a company or
            organization to coordinate deadlines, objectives, and assignments
            for the sake of efficiency and productivity.

            Notion is a SaaS that uses a freemium business model and earns money
            from subscriptions, mostly from team/enterprise subscriptions that
            are commonly used in the workplace. Most of their basic
            functionalities are free but more advanced features are placed
            behind a subscription paywall. Personal Pro accounts cost $5 per
            month, Team plans cost $10 per member per month, and Enterprise
            plans cost $25 per member per month. This is all it has revealed
            regarding its revenue model as it is a private company that has not
            released much information to the public.

            contain users that want to build out product roadmaps and use
            whiteboards to collaborate with others while mapping out their
            sprints.

                More companies are looking to streamline their digital
                operations in light of the “new normal”, where many employees
                are spending a part of their time working from home and are
                adopting a “hybrid” work format. This increases the need to
                develop and/or improve tools to support remote cross-team
                collaboration.

                    Many content creators, primarily young professionals, create
                    videos detailing their lives working in the Tech Industry.
                    For example, there are many videos titled “How to Break Into
                    PM”, or “Day in the Life as a UI/UX Designer”. Notion will
                    sponsor these content creators to bring awareness of the
                    product to a larger audience and receive feedback from real
                    users in the industry.&nbsp;

            Professionals who are already accustomed to a certain software may
            not want to suddenly switch to Notion for PM for their work.
            Adopting a new work process and platform will require training and
            time, and not everyone will be willing to invest the time and
            resources into it. Therefore, implementing new software will need to
            be done gradually which will lead to more time required for the
            product to demonstrate profitability.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ol start="2" class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">

            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Data from previous work/projects will need to be transferred to
            Notion for PM. If Notion for PM does not integrate other software
            into their own, a seamless data transfer process will need to be
            created for teams to not lose any previous work.&nbsp;

          <p>
            Existing users have expressed that one of the downsides of Notion is
            that sometimes users are overwhelmed with the number of features the
            platform offers. Therefore, it is important for the team developing
            Notion for PM to perform the required feature prioritization steps
            to mitigate this risk.&nbsp;

            Certain frameworks or tools used in PM/PMM/UX design may be
            independently developed by other companies. To avoid copyright
            claims, Notion must be cautious in the tools they include in Notion
            for PM and purchase user rights if they choose to outsource.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><u>Next Steps</u></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There may be some copyright issues when creating Notion’s version of
            PM software, especially if frameworks are independently developed by
            competitors. Notion will need to possibly purchase rights to use its
            tools on its own platform, which will lengthen the time needed to
            release the product and incur additional costs. An alternate
            solution for this risk would be to acquire smaller companies that
            develop PM tools and frameworks. Therefore, it is important to
            perform the necessary due diligence before entering a new market and
            introducing a plan for a new product. It is also important to
            conduct user-testing consultations with a pilot of this new product
            with PMs/PMMs/ UX Designers before releasing it to the public. If we
            had more time, we would conduct interviews with professionals in the
            industry to get a better sense of their preferences and pain points
            to better tailor Notion for PM’s product offerings.

          <p>
            Attempting to disrupt an existing market is challenging, and a
            company that is successful in one market may not necessarily be in
            another. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the current market
            landscape using the PESTLE analysis framework to access whether or
            not the product will be profitable, or if the timing of the release
            is appropriate. Many external variables can also affect the success
            of a new product launch, which is why PMs and stakeholders need to
            make informed decisions and business manage risk.

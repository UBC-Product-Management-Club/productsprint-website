  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>Project Summary</strong></h2>
  <p>
    For this project, I was a product manager for Kindertales, a childcare
    management app. To arrive at my solution, I conducted user research and
    interviews, identified pain points, and used product management-specific
    frameworks to narrow down a viable opportunity.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>Project Proposal</strong></h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Introducing Kindertales</strong></h2>
  <p>
    As a new dad, one of my most frequently used apps is Kindertales, a
    childcare management software that provides updates from my child’s daycare
    on her daily activities, offers instant communication with teachers and
    general broadcast announcements from the principal. The app gives parents
    the comfort of knowing when their children are checked in and out of school.
    And gives us the extra boost of joy when your child’s picture is posted
    during an activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are 3 sets of users for this app: Families, Teachers, Enterprise /
    School Administrators. Families use the software as a receiver of
    information, getting notifications of when their child eats, plays, or
    sleeps. Teachers use the app to track daily activities of a child such as
    diaper changes, meal intakes and playtime activities. School Administrators
    use the app to gather billing details, create security of student check in
    and check outs, and notify parents general communications.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this project, I will be researching and suggesting an improvement to the
    Families user. Speaking with other parents, many at-home and non-franchised
    daycares have not adapted technology into daycare management and are
    updating parents using handwritten notes of their child’s key milestones and
    communicating via email newsletters. Childcare management software can be a
    differentiator for daycares by providing parents with a peace of mind
    throughout the day with real-time updates of their child’s activities. In
    today’s world of hyperconnectivity, parents value the instant notifications
    in case of emergency will often prioritize notifications about their
    children over other applications.

  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>Project Objective</strong></h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Situation:</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Kindertales current only allows for parent-to-teacher and
    parent-to-principal communications. The communication feature within the app
    is similar to email, with an inbox of messages, instead of the chat boxes of
    instant messaging.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a parent who started daycare during Covid, I feel that there is an
    unaddressed pain point of communication amongst parents. Due to health
    measures, parents have not had the chance to interact with each other at
    school functions, therefore there is an absence of parent-to-parent
    relationships and a missing sense of community. Parents do not have a
    channel to reach out to each other to set up playdates/events outside of
    school.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Assumptions:</strong></h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Parents want to create closer friendships with other parents from
        daycare.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Parents want their children to have closer friendships with fellow
        daycare kids.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Parents want to increase communication with other parents</p></li>
    <li><p>Parents want a peer support system with other parents</p></li>
    <li><p>Parents trust other parents with a shared daycare as peers</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Kindertales could increase user engagement by improving their
        communications platform to allow parents to interact and communicate
        amongst themselves.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Kindertales could increase parent-to-parent relationships and help in
        forming a stronger school community within the daycare. Furthermore,
        this could lead to strong word-of-mouth marketing from current parents
        who are enjoying the daycare and surrounding community of parents.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Timeline:</strong></h2>
  <p>I aim to spend 15 hours in total on this project:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li><p>2 hours researching competition and user needs online</p></li>
    <li><p>1 hour of conducting user needs research (3 sets of parents)</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        1 hour of validation with daycare principal about parent communications
        and any pain points she may have with the product
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>3 hours devising a solution</p></li>
    <li><p>3 hours wireframing</p></li>
    <li><p>3 hours on the conclusion and additional writing</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        2 hours cold emailing product team of Kindertales to show them my
        project and ask for real feedback. If no response, connect with their
        competitors.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-xl">Competitive Research</h2>
  <p>
    I based my competitive research on a CNBC video called “<a
      class="cursor-pointer transition duration-100 ease-in-out text-actionAccent-600 hover:text-actionAccentHover-500"

      >Preschool Apps — The Latest Early Education Trend</a
    >” published on Oct 5, 2018. It was based on three companies: Tadpoles,
    Kinderlime and Brightwheel. I wanted to review where these apps are today,
    the funding that they have received and the communication methods they
    provided.

  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>User Research</strong></h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: Would you use Kindertales to communication with
    other parents?
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        "Possibility would use it to communication with other parents in case we
        wanted to set up a play date."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>"</strong>We have a WhatsApp group but <u>better</u> if it was
        in Kindertales. It would be good if announcements and monthly newsletter
        would be in Kindertales. Or like Annual Calendar. Pretty much a one-stop
        shop. Why not even purchase uniforms?"
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: Would you use a Parent-to-Parent messaging
    feature if it's available?
  </p>
  <p>Positive:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        “I would absolutely love this! I’ve wanted to meet the other parents in
        my son’s classroom, becomes friends have playdates etc…but I am SO
        socially awkward.
        <u>I would definitely take advantage of something like this.</u>”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “Great idea! For what it’s worth, our daycare has a Parent Liaison who
        set up WhatsApp groups for each classroom and the parents can just join
        via a link. So that’s a suggestion if you just want a solution right
        now.
        <u
          >But if there was something already within the app that the daycare
          uses, that could be a great tool</u
        >.”
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Negative:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        “No, I don’t need another messaging platform. I want to keep
        communication types segregated to cut down on noise.
        <u
          >I could see this resulting in more frequent engagement from parents
          briefly (before they move to another more convenient messaging app
          once relationships are established).</u
        >
        Is temporary parent engagement desirable?”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        At our daycare they ask if you would be okay to be added to a list that
        is distributed to all the parents of the class
        <u>so it's kind of already there</u>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Initial Research Summary</strong></h2>
  <p>Through the competitive and user research, I discovered the following:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>None of the competition had parent-to-parent communication feature</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Some daycares have established procedures in place to create
        parent-to-parent communication groups using an existing communications
        platform. (i.e. WhatsApp group, Facebook group)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If communications group are not yet established, parents would use the
        in-app parent-to-parent communications feature temporarily, before they
        move to a more convenient messaging app once relationships are
        established
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>Pivot</strong></h2>
  <p>
    At this point, I wanted to pivot and focus on the other set of users for the
    Kindertales app, teachers. I created a post on the Early Childhood Educators
    subreddit (r/ECEProfessionals) and received 4,000+ views. There were three
    pain points that were highlighted and had the most upvotes:
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Boundaries - Parents contacting teachers all hours of the night and
        weekend
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Internal Communications - Inefficient communications from room-to-room,
        teacher-to-teacher (telephone, apps that other teachers don't check
        frequently).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Multiple Entries - Teachers spend too much time with data entry per
        student

    Development efforts for features with automation and voice activation were
    marked with "High Effort", leaving the 1-Click Shortcuts and Mass Entry
    features with a High Value and Low Effort ranking.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Value Proposition</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Kindertale’s Frequently Used Shortcuts will reduce administration time for
    teachers by decreasing screen time for activity entry and help teachers stay
    present with children in their care.

    Currently, teachers have to select the + button at the bottom right of the

    such as Food, Drink and Diapers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Visual Mockup displays the activity icons on beneath the current bar of
    Health, Messages and Reports. This order of the activities bar will be based
    on the frequently used algorithm. Users can then customize the order in the
    Settings page.

  <h2 class="text-xl">Conclusion</h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg">Risks and Mitigation</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Clutter. There is an existing shortcut bar at the top of the screen in
        grey with buttons to Health, Messages and Reports. Introducing an icons
        based activities shortcut will increase the clutter and possibly create
        selection errors by the user.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mitigation: Work with UX designer to understand how to increase the
        space between the two shortcut bars. Potentially switching the
        "Classroom" header with the icons shortcut bar to separate the two
        selection points.

    <strong>What I would have done if I had more time</strong>
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Develop a Research Plan - I raced towards asking fellow parent users of
        the app about their initial thoughts of my feature and asked a lot of
        yes/no and leading questions. I should have slowed down the discovery
        part of this project and create a detailed research plan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Interview the Buyer instead of the Users - Kindertales has two sets of
        users, parents and teachers, but the buyer of this application is the
        school administrator. I did not have enough time to understand their
        business pains. Addressing the buyer's business pains are sometimes the
        most important as they hold the keys to the wallet.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Create a Hi-Fidelilty Prototype - I did not have the time to learn how
        to create a prototype in Figma. I look forward to developing this skill
        in Phase 2 and 3 of the fellowship.
      </p>
    </li>

  <h2 class="text-lg">Lessons Learned</h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Discovery - Product managers spend more time on discovery than
        solutioning/design. Learn how to ask questions without my personal
        biases. Will continue to study the "<a

        Buyer vs User - Understanding the Buyer and User Personas. My mentor's
        feedback was that there may not be a need from the Buyer for the feature
        that I was proposing. Reducing the admin tasks of the User / Teacher may
        not be one of the reasons the Buyer / Administrator may buy the product.
        Therefore, always think back to who the buyer is and how this will
        affect their decision to buy.

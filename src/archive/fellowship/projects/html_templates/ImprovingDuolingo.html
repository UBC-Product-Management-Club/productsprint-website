  <p>
    When I first came to university, I met a bunch of people from all over the
    world! I loved learning about their upbringing, identity, and culture.
    Ultimately, I loved to connect with others with different backgrounds to
    mine. This then intrigued me to learn a new language (Korean) in the hopes
    of being able to immerse myself a bit into a different culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were a variety of options I could choose from. I could take an
    introductory language course at UBC, learn it online on an app like
    Duolingo, or annoy my friends by asking them every word I was unsure of.

    The initial reason I went with the online route and use Duolingo as it was
    free and a popular app on the App Store. Later on, I decided to keep using
    it due to the gamified approach it has. I found that while learning a new
    language is exciting, it often times is extremely hard and can sometimes
    make learners lose interest very quickly. Having something that keeps you
    engaged helps learners combat that dip in interest.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl"><strong>Project Objective</strong></h2>
  <p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
  <p>
    The primary problem I believe that Duolingo is trying to solve is the
    disconnect people have with language barriers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a user, when I start to learn a language on Duolingo, I have a good
    learning experience as there is a structured program where I simply have to
    learn module by module. In each module, I am given a set of words where I am
    tested on speaking, writing, and reading. There is also a streaks feature
    where I would be rewarded as a user for using the app daily. This combined
    with its mascot, a cute, green owl creates a gamified effect which I believe
    helps to enhance user engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, by doing each module, it sometimes feels as though you are going
    through the motions for the sake of learning and later on, forgetting
    certain words that perhaps do not come up in the later modules. Furthermore,
    sometimes, the best way to learn a new language is actually speaking with
    locals.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        User’s memory retention will increase if they are able to see words more
        often, regardless of their knowledge of that word
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        User’s willingness to learn will increase if they are able to motivate
        and discipline themselves (much like doing the dishes on your own rather
        than your parents telling you to do them)
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Duolingo could improve its user’s learning experience by increasing
        personalization among its users, so that they take more ownership of
        their learning.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
  <p>I aim to spend 10 hours in total on this project:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li><p>3 hours researching user needs</p></li>
    <li><p>3 hours honing in on a solution</p></li>
    <li><p>2 hours wire-framing</p></li>
    <li><p>2 hours on the conclusion &amp; additional writing</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl">User Research</h2>
  <p><strong>Research Insights</strong></p>
  <p>
    My user research process was very insightful! I first went about it by
    heading to online forums such as Reddit pages - r/duolingo and
    r/languagelearning as well as app store reviews. I never realized how
    passionate some users were in expressing their pain points and opinions on
    certain features. From watching the mini workshop video about discovering
    opportunities &amp; solutions, when doing user research I tried not to have
    confirmation bias and instead read and listened to users and what they
    really valued.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Like if you guys actually want us to learn either give us like 20 hearts or
    remove the health bar. It limits the amount we learn and it takes a whole
    day to refill 5 little hearts. Terrible experience”
  </p>
  <p>~GoodgAmes69 (App Store User) in Apple App Store reviews</p>
  <p>
    “I really really hate the fact that they made it impossible to repeat old
    skills. I don't actually hate the new concept, just that it literally only
    gives you two options: do some random new lesson, or repeat from the pool of
    everything you've done before (and if you lose your hearts, that's the ONLY
    option).”
  </p>
  <p>~ Der_Pianist (Reddit User) in r/duolingo</p>
  <p>
    “Duolingo is great at creating and maintaining motivation for people to use
    Duolingo. That's the issue. It's strength is creating a habit for itself,
    rather than learning a new language.”
  </p>
  <p>~DaveJWilliams (Reddit User) in r/languagelearning</p>
  <p><strong>User Persona</strong></p>
  <p>
    Through user research, I found that the&nbsp;<strong>Student User</strong
    >&nbsp;is the primary segment I want to address. Here's a persona and their
    needs:

  <h2 class="text-lg">
    <strong>#1 Solution:</strong> Adding the ability to gain more hearts after x
    amount of streak days in a row
  </h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Users have more time to learn rather than spending more time waiting for
        their hearts to revive
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users are more incentivized to log into the app as there is a tangible
        benefit to continue their learning rather than gaining XP which doesn’t
        do much
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Allows users to feel less pressured to always be right, it's supposed to
        be a fun learning experience and not a time to be disappointed because
        you made a mistake
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Technically feasible</p></li>
    <li><p>Not changing the nature of app drastically</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-lg">
    <strong>#2 Solution:</strong> Adding ability to save words to a ‘word bank’
    and be able to create customized quizzes based on it
  </h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Users can retain information/knowledge better by having a centralized
        area to view their desired words
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users can take more ownership of their learning by ‘saving’ the word and
        testing themselves
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-lg"><strong>Value Proposition:</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Duolingo’s gaining hearts feature will incentivize users to maximize their
    learning time, while it’s saving words feature will allow users to take more
    ownership of their learning by creating an optional actionable item for them
    which improves their motivation to learn and thereby improving their
    learning experience.

        complete to earn extra hearts
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Users should be able to save a word</p></li>
    <li><p>Users can quickly see what the words they saved are</p></li>

  <h2 class="text-xl">Conclusion</h2>
  <h2 class="text-lg">Risks and Mitigation</h2>
  <p>
    A huge risk is the education of these 2 features to users. Adding more than
    1 feature per update may potentially confuse users and cause them to not use
    the features at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    To mitigate this, I would little incentives such as added XP/more hearts for
    using the features.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-lg">What I would have done if I had more time</h2>
  <p>
    I would have tried to research the market a little more and perhaps discover
    different customer segments to see how features that I recommended above
    might play out to different users. This is especially because during the
    user research phase, I only interviewed 1 student and got perspectives from
    reddit and app store reviews where there is no information about the user.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-lg">What I learned</h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6">
    <li>
      <p>
        Do your research! Find out what your customers’ pain points are as well
        as what exactly do they value before prototyping a solution. ‘We must
        discover and measure customer’s conception of value’ and this holds
        truth since customers make a product valuable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Being flexible. After doing more research on Duolingo, I revised my
        hypothesis to reflect my findings and thereby was able to create a more
        valuable and catered solution than the one I had initially planned.
